              C4C Campus is a global AI innovation hub focused on building technology that drives meaningful impact. We teach developers to build AI tools for animal advocacy, climate action, and AI safety with ethics built in from day one. Based in Bengaluru with remote options, we offer weekend bootcamps, global hackathons, and a full-time accelerator program.

            <summary class="font-bold cursor-pointer py-2">Who runs C4C Campus?</summary>
            <p class="text-text-muted mt-3">
              C4C Campus is a joint venture between <a href="http://openpaws.ai/">Open Paws</a> and <a href="https://www.electricsheep.is/">Electric Sheep</a>, two organizations focused on using AI for positive impact in animal welfare, climate action, and AI safety.

            <summary class="font-bold cursor-pointer py-2">What does "engineering compassion" mean?</summary>
            <p class="text-text-muted mt-3">
              Engineering compassion means building compassion INTO AI tools and technology from the start, not adding ethics as an afterthought. This applies at every layer of the stack - from model training to application design to deployment choices. We teach developers to build AI tools that recognize animal sentience, respect ecological boundaries, actively protect under pressure, and maintain ethical behavior even in adversarial situations.

            <summary class="font-bold cursor-pointer py-2">Do I need to be in India to apply?</summary>
            <p class="text-text-muted mt-3">
              No! We welcome international applicants. The bootcamp offers remote participation. The accelerator includes in-person sessions in Bengaluru, so you'll need to be able to travel there for those portions. Hackathons run globally, so check specific event locations.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="card">
            <summary class="font-bold cursor-pointer py-2">Is there an age requirement?</summary>
            <p class="text-text-muted mt-3">
              No specific age requirement, but you should be able to commit to the program schedule and work independently or in teams. Most participants are 18+.

            <summary class="font-bold cursor-pointer py-2">Do I need to care about all three domains?</summary>
            <p class="text-text-muted mt-3">
              No - you can focus on just one (animal advocacy, climate action, or AI safety) or work on hybrid projects that address multiple domains. What matters is genuine commitment to your chosen focus area.
            </p>

          <details class="card">
            <summary class="font-bold cursor-pointer py-2">How long does the application process take?</summary>
            <p class="text-text-muted mt-3">
              For bootcamp: Response within 2 weeks. For accelerator: We review applications on a rolling basis and will schedule interviews with promising candidates. The full process typically takes 2-4 weeks. For hackathons: Usually faster, depends on the specific event.
