## How to Engage Respectfully

### Asking Good Questions

**Structure:**
1. **Context:** What are you trying to do?
2. **Problem:** What's not working?
3. **Attempt:** What have you already tried?
4. **Expected:** What do you expect to happen?
5. **Actual:** What's actually happening?

**Example Good Question:**
```
I'm building an n8n workflow to send emails.

Goal: When a form is submitted, send a confirmation email.

What I've tried:
- Added HTTP Request node to get form data
- Added Gmail node
- Connected them

Problem: Getting "Invalid credentials" error on Gmail node

I've double-checked my Gmail password. What am I missing?
```

**Example Bad Question:**
```
Help!!! Gmail isn't working!!! What do I do???
```

### Giving Constructive Feedback

**Formula:**
1. **Appreciate:** Acknowledge the effort
2. **Clarify:** Ask questions before criticizing
3. **Suggest:** Offer improvement ideas
4. **Encourage:** Build them up

**Example Good Feedback:**
```
Great attempt! I like how you structured the workflow.

A couple questions:
- Why did you choose the HTTP Request node over the webhook?
- Did you test the connection to the API first?

One suggestion: Add error handling for network timeouts.

Keep it up - you're getting there!
```

**Example Bad Feedback:**
```
This is wrong. Your code is bad. You didn't do it right.
```

### Disagreeing Respectfully

**Do This:**
1. **Understand:** Make sure you understand their position
2. **Respectfully Disagree:** "I see your point, but I think..."
3. **Explain:** Share your reasoning with evidence
4. **Stay Curious:** "What makes you think that?"
5. **Find Common Ground:** Where do you agree?

**Example Respectful Disagreement:**
```
Great point! I've tried that approach too. Here's what I found:
- It works for simple cases
- It gets complicated with [specific scenario]
- I've had better luck with [alternative] because...

Have you tried [alternative]? What's your experience been?
```

**Example Disrespectful Disagreement:**
```
That's completely wrong. You clearly don't understand.
```

### Supporting Classmates

**When Someone's Struggling:**
- "I get it - this part is tricky. Here's what helped me..."
- "You're not alone in struggling with this"
- "Want to work through this together?"

**When Someone's New:**
- Offer help proactively
- Celebrate their questions
- Share resources
- Make them feel welcome

**When Someone's Asking for Help:**
- Guide them to the answer (don't just give it)
- "Try this step, then let me know what happens"
- Ask clarifying questions
- Be patient

## FAQ

### Q: Is it OK to ask for help on an assignment?

**A:** Yes! But there's a difference between getting help and cheating:

**OK:**
- "I'm stuck on step 2, how do I approach this?"
- "Can you explain what this error means?"
- "Here's my code, does this logic look right?"

**NOT OK:**
- "Can you just do this for me?"
- "What's the answer to question 3?"
- "Give me the solution code"

**Rule of thumb:** You should be able to explain every line of your code.

### Q: What if I disagree with something someone said?

**A:** Disagreement is healthy! Just do it respectfully:

**Good:**
- "I see your point, but I think..."
- "That's an interesting perspective. Here's my experience..."
- "I respectfully disagree because..."

**Bad:**
- "You're wrong and stupid"
- "Only an idiot would think that"
