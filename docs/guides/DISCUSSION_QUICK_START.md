## Key Concepts

### Two Types of Discussions

**Lesson Discussions:**
- Specific to one lesson
- Threaded (nested replies)
- For questions about lesson content

**Course Forums:**
- Course level (not lesson-specific)
- Can be locked
- For general Q&A, projects, announcements

### Teacher Responses

When a teacher replies, they get a special 👨‍🏫 badge showing it's authoritative.

### Pinned Content

Items marked with 📌 are pinned (important). They appear at the top of the list.

### Locked Threads

Items marked with 🔒 are locked. Students can't reply, but the thread stays visible.
