## Key Concepts

### Student Progress Levels

```
Green (Tier 1): 70%+ progress, healthy engagement
  → No intervention needed, celebrate success

Yellow (Tier 2): 40-69% progress, slight concerns
  → Provide supportive resources, check in weekly

Orange (Tier 3): 20-39% progress, significant concerns
  → Phone call, support plan, intensive monitoring

Red (Tier 4): <20% progress, critical concerns
  → Urgent contact, extensive support, consider alternatives
```

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means | Healthy Range |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Progress % | Lessons completed / total lessons | 70%+ for pace |
| Engagement Score | Activity and participation level | 75+ (0-100) |
| Last Activity | Days since last login | 0-3 days |
| Completion Rate | % of cohort who finished | 30%+ by end |
