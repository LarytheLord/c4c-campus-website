## Overview

Supporting struggling students is one of the most impactful roles teachers play. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for identifying at-risk students early, implementing targeted interventions, and measuring their effectiveness.

### Why Early Identification Matters

Research shows that:
- **67%** of at-risk students can be helped with early intervention
- Students identified in week 1-2 have **3x higher** completion rates
- Personalized support increases engagement scores by **25-35%**
- Early intervention reduces dropout rate by **40%**

### This Guide Covers
- Warning signs and risk indicators
- Tier-based intervention framework
- Specific support strategies
- Communication templates
- Tracking and measurement
- Case examples
- When to escalate

## Identifying Struggling Students

### Where to Find Struggling Students

#### 1. Progress Dashboard

The Progress Dashboard automatically identifies students meeting at-risk criteria:

**Dashboard Path:**
- Teacher Dashboard → Progress Dashboard → Select Cohort
- Struggling students appear in dedicated section
- Color-coded by risk level (At-Risk / High-Risk)

**Information Provided:**
- Student name and email
- Current progress percentage
- Last activity date
- Engagement score
- Risk category

#### 2. Student Roster

Use the Student Roster for detailed individual analysis:

**Roster Path:**
- Teacher Dashboard → Select Cohort → View Roster
- Filter by status and progress
- Sort by last activity

**Analysis Strategy:**
- Filter by "Active" status
- Sort by "Last Activity" (oldest first)
- Review top 20-30 students for intervention

#### 3. Manual Monitoring

Regular check-ins reveal problems dashboards might miss:

**Weekly Check Routine:**
- Review discussion forum activity
- Note quiz/assessment performance
- Check assignment submissions
- Observe engagement in live sessions

**Monthly Deep Dive:**
- Export roster and analyze trends
- Identify patterns in specific lessons
- Compare this month vs. last month
- Look for cohort-wide issues

### Risk Indicators Checklist

Use this checklist to quickly assess if a student needs support:

```

**Timeline:** Re-assess after 10-14 days

### Tier 4 (Red) Interventions

**Goal:** Intensive support to prevent course withdrawal

#### Step 1: Urgent Direct Contact
- Phone call (not just email)
- Within 24 hours
- Brief, direct, supportive

**Script:**
```
"Hi [Student], this is [Your Name] from [Course].
I'm calling because I haven't heard from you in a while
and I want to make sure everything is okay.
Can we talk for a few minutes?"

[Listen, ask questions, express genuine care]

"Your success matters to me. I want to find a way
to help you succeed. Here's what I'm thinking...
Can you commit to [specific action] by [specific date]?"
```

#### Step 2: Rapid Assessment
- Determine if course is still appropriate
- Understand if personal crisis is involved
- Assess if student wants to continue
- Identify any barriers to success

#### Step 3: Strategic Options

**Option A: Intensive Support**
- Extended deadline
- Reduced workload
- Daily or every-other-day check-ins
- One-on-one tutoring
- Simplified curriculum

**Option B: Course Adjustment**
- Move to different cohort (slower pace, different time)
- Pause and resume later
- Flexible timeline
- Hybrid completion

**Option C: Course Withdrawal**
- Respectful, non-punitive withdrawal
- Financial aid implications explained

- Resource connection (advising, counseling)

**Decision Framework:**
```
Can student realistically succeed with intensive support?
YES → Implement Option A
NO → Explore Options B or C

Does student want to continue?
YES → Provide intensive support
NO → Facilitate withdrawal with care and next steps

Are there extenuating circumstances?
YES → Offer flexibility and extended timeline
NO → Still offer support, but realistic about expectations
```

#### Step 4: Create Emergency Support Plan

```
EMERGENCY INTERVENTION PLAN

Status: CRITICAL

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (48 hours):
□ Phone/video call completed

```

#### Step 5: Escalate If Needed
- Contact academic advisor
- Refer to student services/counseling
- Notify department head
- Document all interactions
- Plan for next steps

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Student indicates mental health crisis
- Family/domestic emergency

**Example Success Story:**

```
SUCCESS STORY: Maria's Transformation

Maria started strong but hit a wall in week 3 when she struggled
with a difficult concept. Her engagement dropped and she didn't
log in for 10 days.

When I called to check in, she expressed frustration and was
considering dropping. Rather than let that happen, we:
1. Created simplified materials for the tough concept
2. Scheduled regular check-in calls
3. Connected her with a peer tutor
4. Extended her deadline

Within two weeks, her engagement rebounded. She told me later:
"Your willingness to help made all the difference. I almost quit,
but I'm so glad I didn't."

Maria went on to complete the course and scored 92% on the
final assessment.

LESSON: Early intervention + personalized support = transformation
```
