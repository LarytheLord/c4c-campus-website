## Module 1: Getting Started with Moderation

### What is Moderation?

**Moderation** means managing online discussions to keep them:
- On-topic and productive
- Respectful and safe
- High-quality and valuable
- Accessible to all students

**Your Role as Moderator:**
- Guide discussions toward learning goals
- Remove harmful or off-topic content
- Answer questions and clarify concepts
- Model respectful communication
- Create an inclusive learning environment

### Why Moderation Matters

**Good moderation:**
- Increases student engagement
- Reduces anxiety about asking questions
- Prevents harassment and bullying
- Maintains focus on learning
- Builds community
- Attracts quality discussions

**Without moderation:**
- Spam and ads clutter discussions
- Misinformation spreads
- Students feel unsafe
- Harassment goes unchecked
- Valuable answers get buried
- Trolls derail conversations

### Your Moderation Philosophy

**Before you start, consider:**

**What kind of community do I want?**
- Collaborative? Competitive?
- Formal? Casual?
- Large discussions? Focused threads?
- Student-led? Teacher-guided?

**My approach to student contributions:**
- Do I want to answer everything immediately?
- Should students answer each other first?
- How do I validate good student contributions?
- What's my response time expectation?

**How I'll handle violations:**
- What's my bar for deletion vs. editing?
- How will I respond to first-time violations?
- What's my escalation path for serious issues?
- How transparent will I be about moderation?

**Example Philosophy Statement:**
```
I will foster a collaborative learning community where:
- Students feel safe asking questions
- Peer learning is encouraged and celebrated
- Teachers provide guidance, not just answers
- Discussions stay focused on learning
- Violations are handled respectfully and fairly
```

- Community makes learning better
- You're not alone - reach out for support

**Your Goal:**
Create a learning community where students feel:
- Safe to ask questions
- Valued for their contributions
- Supported by peers and teachers
- Encouraged to help each other
- Part of something larger

**Thank you for taking this training. Your work as a moderator matters!**
