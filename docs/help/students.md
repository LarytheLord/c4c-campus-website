## What is a Cohort?

A **cohort** is a group of students learning the same course together on a set schedule.

### Why Cohorts?

Instead of taking a course alone, you're part of a learning community:
- **All students progress together** - Everyone covers Module 1 the same week
- **Community discussions** - Chat with classmates in real-time
- **Structured pacing** - Content releases gradually, keeping everyone engaged
- **Teacher support** - Your instructor is actively leading the cohort

### Cohort vs. Self-Paced

| Aspect | Cohort | Self-Paced |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Start date | Fixed | Whenever you want |
| Pacing | Set schedule | Your pace |
| Classmates | Yes | No |
| Discussions | Yes | No |
| Teacher involved | Active | Optional |

## Understanding Module Locks

### What Are Locked Modules?

A **locked module** means the content isn't available yet. It will unlock on a specific date set by your teacher.

### Why Do Modules Lock?

Your teacher uses locked modules to:
- **Keep everyone on the same schedule** - Everyone does Module 1 the same week
- **Pace learning** - Give you time between modules
- **Enable discussions** - When a module unlocks, all students can discuss it together
- **Manage workload** - Prevents you from rushing ahead

### Locked Module Display

When you see a locked module:

```
[LOCKED] Module 2: Advanced Strategies

Unlocks: March 8, 2025 (3 days remaining)

Preview:
Learn advanced strategies for effective advocacy
including case studies and practical frameworks.
```

### What You Can Do

When a module is locked:
- **See the description** - Read what the module is about
- **View the unlock date** - Know when it becomes available
- **Check the countdown** - See how many days remaining
- **Review other modules** - Continue with unlocked content
- **Can't**: Start the lessons or watch videos

### When Module Unlocks

On the unlock date:
- The module button changes from [LOCKED] to [UNLOCKED]
- You can immediately click and start lessons
- Your teacher might post announcements
- Check discussions for classmate insights

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I enroll in multiple cohorts of the same course?

**A:** No, you can only be in one cohort per course. If you want to switch:
1. Unenroll from current cohort
2. Enroll in the new cohort
3. Note: Your progress resets

### Q: What if I miss the start date?

**A:** You can enroll in an active cohort anytime. You'll:
- See all previously unlocked content immediately
- Have access to not-yet-unlocked content on their unlock dates
- Be able to catch up at your own pace

**Note**: You start from the beginning (progress counter at 0).

### Q: Can I reenroll in a cohort I dropped?

**A:** It depends on the cohort status:
- **Active cohort**: Usually yes, if space available
- **Completed cohort**: Usually yes, for review
- **Archived cohort**: No, it's closed

Ask your teacher if you're unsure.

### Q: Can I access content after the end date?

**A:** Yes! The end date is just when the cohort officially concludes. You can usually:
- Continue accessing content indefinitely
- Catch up on missed lessons
- Review completed material

Unless the teacher explicitly archives the cohort (which restricts access).

### Q: What if my cohort is full?

**A:** If you see "Cohort Full" or "30/30 enrolled":
- Check if another cohort is available
- Contact your teacher about adding capacity
- Ask to be added to a waitlist (if available)

### Q: How is my progress tracked?

**A:** The system tracks:
- Which lessons you've watched
- How long you spent on each
- Completion status
- When you last accessed the course
- Time of day you study

Your teacher can see this data to help support you.

### Q: Can I download course materials?

**A:** It depends on the lesson:
- **Videos**: Usually can't be downloaded (stream only)
- **Resources**: Look for download links below the video
- **Transcripts**: May be available as text files
- **Handouts**: Can be printed or saved

Check each lesson for available download options.

### Q: What if a module is incorrectly marked as locked?

**A:** Tell your teacher! It might be:
- A technical glitch (try refreshing)
- An incorrect unlock date
- A browser cache issue (clear cache and reload)

Your teacher can manually grant access if needed.
