Today, we're launching the tool that the animal liberation movement has been waiting for.

For years, there's been a gap: advanced animal advocates who want to learn AI, but can't find training that speaks their language. AI courses are designed for tech companies, not social movements.

⚡ Hackathons (48-hour sprints): Build real tools in a sprint setting. Prototypes that actually matter.

🚀 Accelerator (3-6 months): Go from idea to production. We provide mentorship, infrastructure, and user feedback for your team.

Built for the Global South. Works on 3G. Designed for liberation.

We're looking for:
✅ Student advocates ready to learn
✅ Teacher experts with knowledge to share
✅ Community members to build this with us

Join us: https://c4c.com

The infrastructure for animal liberation starts here.

🧵 Introducing C4C Campus: A new approach to AI education for animal liberation.

For years, animal advocates have faced a problem:

AI is powerful. AI can accelerate liberation.

But AI education is designed for tech companies, not movements. Courses assume you have coding knowledge, expensive equipment, and months of time.

That changes today. →

We built C4C Campus specifically for animal liberation organizations.

Three ways to engage:
1️⃣ Bootcamp: Learn AI in 4-8 weeks (self-paced, free)
2️⃣ Hackathons: Build in 48 hours
3️⃣ Accelerator: Take your idea to production

Built for slow internet. Works on $100 phones. Designed for Global South.

Free during Phase 1.
