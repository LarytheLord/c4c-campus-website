### Troubleshooting for Admins

**Q: Users report they can't log in. What do I do?**

A: Login troubleshooting steps:
1. Check if user account exists (Users list)
2. Check if account is active (not deactivated)
3. Have user check their email for typos
4. Have user reset password
5. Clear browser cache and try again
6. Check if email is verified (for new accounts)
7. Check rate limiting (5 attempts per minute)

If still failing, check server logs or contact Supabase support.

**Q: A course has the wrong teacher assigned. How do I fix it?**

A: Change course ownership:
1. Go to Courses section
2. Find the course
3. Click "Edit Course"
4. Change "Course Owner" field
5. Save

The original teacher loses access. New teacher gains access. Data and enrollments remain.

**Q: Enrollment numbers seem wrong. How do I verify?**

A: Verify enrollment counts:
1. Go to Analytics
2. Check "Enrollment Report"
3. Cross-check with course enrollment page
4. Export data for review
5. Run verification script (if available)

If numbers are truly off, contact Supabase support for database query help.

**Q: A student reports their progress was lost. How do I help?**

A: Recover lost progress:
1. Check student account in Users
2. Check lesson_progress table (if admin access)
3. Check video resume data
4. Verify with student what they completed
5. Manually update progress if needed (last resort)

Data is rarely lost - usually browser cache issue.

**Q: How do I scale the platform for more users?**

A: Scaling recommendations:
- **1,000-10,000 users**: Current setup works fine
- **10,000-100,000 users**: Enable query caching, read replicas
- **100,000+ users**: Database sharding, regional deployments

Contact Supabase support for scaling assistance.
